# Twitter

I stumbled across [Stylistic Word Clouds](https://github.com/minimaxir/stylistic-word-clouds) done by [Max Woolf](http://minimaxir.com/) that inspired me in making this project.

My objective was to make a masked word cloud with Python and get Twitter's tweets using [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) - used to access Twitter's API.
